# This workflow will run changesets depending on two different scenarios:
#
# 1. If we are landing a specific commit into main (Author PR), then
#    changesets will check if there are changes verifying the Markdown files
#    generated automatically:
#
#    a) There are new versions and there's NO Release PR, then the changesets
#    action will create a new Release PR.
#
#    b) There's a Release PR, then the changesets action will update the
#    existing Release PR with the new commit.
#
#    NOTE: (in both cases, changesets will modify the new version in
#    package.json for each package, and will remove the MD files as part of the
#    Release PR).
#
# 2. If we are landing the Release PR into main, then the changesets action
#    will publish the changes to npm.
