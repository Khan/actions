/**
 * Balance markdown code regions by ensuring fences are properly matched.
 *
 * This module repairs markdown content where code regions (fenced code blocks)
 * may have improperly nested or unbalanced opening and closing fences.
 *
 * Problem:
 * AI models sometimes generate markdown with nested code regions using the same
 * indentation level, causing parsing issues. For example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * function example() {
 *   ```
 *   nested content (this shouldn't be here)
 *   ```
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Common AI-Generated Error Patterns (in order of frequency):
 * 1. Unclosed code blocks at end of content (FIXED: adds closing fence)
 * 2. Nested fences at same indentation level (FIXED: escapes by increasing fence length)
 * 3. Mixed fence types causing confusion (HANDLED: treats ` and ~ separately)
 * 4. Indented bare fences in markdown examples (HANDLED: preserves as content)
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Supports both backtick (`) and tilde (~) fences
 * - Minimum fence length is 3 characters
 * - A fence must be at least as long as the opening fence to close it
 * - Fences can have optional language specifiers
 * - Indentation is preserved but doesn't affect matching
 * - Content inside code blocks should never contain valid fences
 * - Indented fences (different indentation than opener) are treated as content

/**
 * Balance markdown code regions by attempting to fix mismatched fences.
 *
 * The algorithm:
 * 1. Normalize line endings to ensure consistent processing
 * 2. Parse through markdown line by line, skipping XML comment regions
 * 3. Track code block state (open/closed)
 * 4. When nested fences are detected, increase outer fence length by 1
 * 5. Ensure all opened code blocks are properly closed
 * 6. Quality check: Verify the result doesn't create more unbalanced regions
 *    than the original input - if it does, return the original (normalized)
 *
 * Quality guarantees:
 * - Never creates MORE unbalanced code regions than the input
 * - Always normalizes line endings (\r\n -> \n)
 * - If the algorithm would degrade quality, returns original content
 * - Preserves indentation and fence character types
 *
 * @param {string} markdown - Markdown content to balance
 * @returns {string} Balanced markdown with properly matched code regions
